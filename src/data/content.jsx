Our hope is that this initiative will allow Sri Lanka’s Vanilla export sector to grow to a value of USD 1 Billion, helping bring foreign revenue to the country as well as creating a brand for Sri Lankan vanilla, similar to the popularity of Ceylon Tea. This project will massively boost Sri Lanka’s agro export sector overall as our crops will be organically grown, setting a great example. We will also create many job opportunities over the course of this, and help the economies of the places we have put this project in motion.",
